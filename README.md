analyzed the 6 csv's: Departments, Titles Employees, Deptmanager Deptemp salaries. Then made a ERD Diagram of all the tables choosing the primary keys and foreign keys of each table. Next I created each table in PD Admin and analyzed it some more by comparing each table and joining them together. My results are in my folders and my concluson.
